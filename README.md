# Binary-Pattern

### Overview

This dataset consists of binary sequences (0s and 1s) structured for predictive modeling. It captures historical patterns that can be used to forecast future values. The dataset is ideal for time-series analysis, machine learning classification, and sequential prediction tasks.

### Dataset Structure

Rows: Each row represents a unique binary sequence.

Columns: The dataset initially lacked column names, so they were auto-generated as Feature_0, Feature_1, etc.

Target Variable: The goal is to predict the next binary value (0 or 1) for each sequence.

### Usage

Data Preprocessing:

Assign column headers if missing.

Create lagged features to incorporate historical values.

Handle missing values.

Training Models:

Utilize Random Forest, Decision Trees, or LSTMs for binary value prediction.

Address class imbalance using SMOTE or class weighting.

Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score to measure performance.

Use confusion matrices to understand misclassifications.
